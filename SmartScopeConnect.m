% SmartScopeConnect - Connects and initializes the SmartScope using Matlab
%
% Prerequisites:
% - make sure the latest SmartScope software has been installed on this machine
% - make sure the first line of code refers to the correct location of LabNation.DeviceInterface.dll
% - make sure no other program is currently accessing the SmartScope
% - make sure a SmartScope is attached to this machine
%
% Usage:
% - just run the thing and you'll hear the SmartScope click hello
% - now hook up a 10kHz signal to ChA
% - run SmartScopePlot to see the results visualized in a graph
%
% Good to know:
% - you can only link to the .NET assembly and scope once (Matlab limitation). Therefore, that code is enclosed inside the if clause below
%
% Tested on Matlab R2014a_64b+Windows8_64b
